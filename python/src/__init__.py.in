# This file is a workaround for a limitation in out protobuf python generation
# where a message that depends on another message will try to import the
# corresponding python module using `gz.msgs` as the package name. However,
# we're installing the python modules in a directory that contains the gz-msgs
# major version number, so the import fails. This hack here overwrites the
# entry for the unversioned module name in `sys.modules` to point to the
# versioned module the first time a message module is loaded. Subsequent
# imports with or without the major version number will work properly.

import sys

unversioned_module = "gz.msgs"
versioned_module = "gz.msgs@PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR@"
if unversioned_module in sys.modules:
    print("Looks like you are combining different versions of {}. Found {} and"
          "{} This is not supported".format(sys.modules[unversioned_module],
                                            sys.modules[versioned_module]))
