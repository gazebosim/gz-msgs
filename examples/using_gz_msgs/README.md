# Using gz-msgs as part of your project 

With the new message generation pipeline, downstream users of `gz-msgs` must now generate messages as part of their build process.

The example in this folder demonstrates how to build messages as part of your build.


## Finding gz-cmake

To begin with, in your project `CMakeLists.txt`, you must find `gz-msgs`:

```
find_package(gz-msgs10 REQUIRED)
set(GZ_MSGS_VER ${gz-msgs10_VERSION_MAJOR})
```

Once `gz-msgs` is available, there are three main CMake functions to use.

## Enumerating installed messages

The first CMake function retrieves the path to the installed `gz-msgs` proto files, as well as the listing of all available messages.
It will populate the variables passed to the arguments when run.

```
# Get the gz-msgs installed messages and generate a library from them
gz_msgs_get_installed_messages(
  # Root path of the installed gz-msgs proto files
  MESSAGES_PATH_VARIABLE MSGS_PATH
  # List of paths to each gz-msgs proto file
  MESSAGES_PROTOS_VARIABLE MSGS_PROTOS)
```

At this point, the `MSGS_PROTOS` variable will contain all available messages.
If you do not need all the messages, the [`list(FILTER)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/command/list.html)  can be used to include/exclude particular messages.

## Generating messages

With the list of available messages, we proceed to the generation step:

```
gz_msgs_generate_messages(
  # Target created for library/executable linking
  TARGET gz_msgs_gen
  # Protobuf package name, always gz.msgs for installed messages
  PROTO_PACKAGE "gz.msgs"
  # Base path of the installed files (output of previous step)
  MSGS_PATH ${MSGS_PATH}
  # List of protos to generate files (output of previous step)
  MSGS_PROTOS ${MSGS_PROTOS})
```

This will output a target `gz_msgs_gen` that can be used to link against.

## Linking messages

Once the target is generated, it can be either linked via `target_link_libraries` in CMake, or using the custom `target_link_messages` macro.

`target_link_messages` will perform whole-archive linking, which guarantees that all the message definitions will be visible in the final output, regardless of link-time optimization.

```
# Automatically uses whole-archive linking to get all the messages available
target_link_messages(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE MSG_TARGETS gz_msgs_gen)
```

In general, library linkage to messages should be `PRIVATE`, as we don't install the message library or headers.
