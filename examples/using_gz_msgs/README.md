# Using gz-msgs as part of your project 

The example in this folder demonstrates how to use messages as part of your build.

To use messages as part of your project, simply find the gz-msgs package

```
find_package(gz-msgs10 REQUIRED)
set(GZ_MSGS_VER ${gz-msgs10_VERSION_MAJOR}
```

And link the messages library to your library or executable

```
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cc)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE gz-msgs${GZ_MSGS_VER})
```
